# folajimi-cybersecurity-portfolio
This is my cybersecurity portfolio, showcasing security audits, risk assessments, and compliance based on NIST. It includes hands-on work with Linux, SQL, asset management, threats, vulnerabilities, detection, and incident response. I also demonstrate skills in Wireshark, tcpdump, IDS (Suricata), SIEM (Splunk, Chronicle), and Python automation.
