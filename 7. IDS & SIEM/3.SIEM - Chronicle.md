# SIEM - Chronicle
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools play a crucial role in monitoring and analyzing security data within an organization. Chronicle, a cloud-native service developed by Google, is specifically built for enterprises to efficiently store, analyze, and query vast amounts of security and network telemetry.

## Overview
In Chronicle, the search process is straightforward using the Search bar, and it allows for enhanced filtering through Procedural Filtering to refine results. By filtering results based on specific event types or log sources, security analysts can gain deeper insights into suspicious activities. YARA-L, a specialized search language, is used for defining rules to search through the ingested log data. Chronicle supports two search modes:

- **Unified Data Mode (UDM)**: The default search type. UDM provides faster results by searching through structured and indexed security data that has already been parsed and normalized. 
- **Raw Log Search**: A slower but more granular search that looks through raw, unprocessed logs. This method allows searching for specifics like usernames, filenames, or hashes and supports regular expressions to match patterns.

## Scenario
As a security analyst at a financial services company, you’ve received an alert indicating that an employee has received a phishing email. Upon investigation, you identify a suspicious domain `signin.office365x24.com` embedded within the email’s content. Your task is to use Chronicle to determine if other employees have received emails containing this domain and if any have interacted with it.

## Expectation
- Investigate threat intelligence associated with the domain.
- Identify the assets that have interacted with the domain.
- Review the HTTP events related to the domain.
- Determine which assets may have submitted login credentials to the domain.
- Identify other domains related to the primary suspicious domain.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Launch Chronicle.**
   Open the Chronicle platform to start your investigation.

2. **Perform a Domain Search.**
   In the search bar, enter `signin.office365x24.com` and hit "Search". This will return results related to the domain. Click on the domain under the `DOMAINS` section to proceed with the search.
   
   - **Key Information from the Search:**
     - **VirusTotal (VT) Context**: Chronicle shows that 7 security vendors have flagged this domain as malicious.
     - **WHOIS Information**: Details about the domain, including its contact information and origin.
     - **Prevalence**: A graph showing the frequency of domain access, including dates such as July 9th, 2023, and February 10th, 2024.
     - **Resolved IP**: The domain resolves to two IP addresses: `104.215.148.63` and `40.100.174.34`.
     - **Sibling Domains**: A related domain, `login.office365x24.com`, was also identified.
     - **ET Intelligence Report**: The domain was classified as a "drop site for logs or stolen credentials" by ProofPoint’s Emerging Threats Intelligence.

3. **Review Timeline and HTTP Events.**
   Chronicle provides a timeline of interactions with the domain, including HTTP requests such as `GET` and `POST`. 

   - **HTTP Request Details:**
     - `GET`: Used to retrieve data from a server.
     - `POST`: Used to submit data to a server.
   
   This data is vital for identifying potentially harmful interactions between users and the domain.

4. **Analyze Assets Involved.**
   Chronicle’s search results show a list of assets that have accessed the malicious domain. In this case, the following assets were identified:

   - `ashton-davidson-pc`
   - `bruce-monroe-pc`
   - `coral-alvarez-pc`
   - `emil-palmer-pc`
   - `jude-reyes-pc`
   - `roger-spence-pc`

   These are the computers that accessed `signin.office365x24.com`.

5. **Investigate Further.**
   The investigation reveals the following:

   - **IP Addresses**: The two IP addresses resolving to `signin.office365x24.com` are `104.215.148.63` and `40.100.174.34`. The IP `40.100.174.34` is associated with both `signin.office365x24.com` and another domain `signin.accounts-google.com`.
   - **POST Requests**: Three `POST` requests were made to `40.100.174.34`, with the target URL being `http://signin.office365x24.com/login.php`. This could indicate that credentials were submitted to the phishing site.
