# Cyberattack Mindset: Parking Lot USB Drive  

## 🏥 Scenario  

You are a **cybersecurity analyst** at **Medisecure Hospital**, responsible for safeguarding patient data and hospital operations. One morning, you arrive at work and notice a **USB drive** lying in the hospital parking lot. The drive has the hospital’s **official logo** printed on it, making it appear legitimate. However, no one is around who might have dropped it.  

Out of curiosity—and following security procedures—you take the USB drive back to your office, where your team has **virtualization software** installed. This software runs an **isolated test environment**, allowing you to safely examine the USB stick without risking infection to other systems.  

Upon inspection, the USB drive contains a **mix of personal and work-related files**, including:  
- **Family and pet photos**  
- **A new hire letter**  
- **Employee shift schedules**  
- **Confidential hospital documents**  

This raises **serious security concerns**:  
🔴 **Was this drive lost accidentally, or was it planted as part of an attack?**  
🔴 **How could an attacker use the information inside?**  
🔴 **What risks does this pose to the hospital’s network and employees?**

## 🕵️‍♂️ Attacker’s Mindset  

A **malicious actor** could use the **extracted data** in various ways:  

| **Attack Strategy**  | **Potential Impact**  |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Phishing Attack**  | Attackers craft emails targeting Jorge (the likely owner), using personal details from the USB drive to make them convincing.  |
| **Social Engineering** | An attacker could pose as hospital IT staff, requesting Jorge's credentials under the pretense of “recovering lost data.” |
| **Credential Theft** | If the USB contains login credentials, attackers could access hospital systems and steal sensitive patient data. |
| **Malware Injection** | The USB might contain an **autorun malware script**, infecting systems as soon as it’s plugged into an unsecured computer. |

## ⚠️ Risk Analysis  

| **Threat**                 | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Risk Level** |
|---------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Employees plug in unknown USBs** | **High** | **High** | **Critical** |
| **Phishing emails targeting staff** | **High** | **High** | **Critical** |
| **Sensitive hospital data leaked** | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |
| **Malware infection from USB** | **Medium** | **High** | **High** |

## 🛠️ Preventative Measures  

### **1️⃣ Employee Security Awareness (Managerial Control)**  
✅ **Conduct regular cybersecurity training** on **USB threats and social engineering attacks**.  
✅ **Implement a strict “No Unknown USB” policy**, requiring all found USBs to be turned in to IT.  

### **2️⃣ System Protections (Technical & Operational Controls)**  
✅ **Disable AutoPlay** on all hospital workstations to prevent malware execution.  
✅ **Enforce endpoint protection**—automatically scan **all USB devices** before allowing access.  
✅ **Restrict USB access** to only authorized personnel with **encrypted hospital-issued drives**.  

### **3️⃣ Incident Response Protocol**  
✅ If a **suspicious USB drive is found**, IT should:  
- **Isolate it** in a controlled environment (e.g., virtualization software).  
- **Scan for malware** using up-to-date antivirus and endpoint protection tools.  
- **Investigate metadata** for potential clues about its origin.  
- **Report findings** to security teams and **log the incident**.
