# Vulnerability Assessment  

## Scenario  
**SwiftCart Solutions**, a fast-growing e-commerce company, as a **cybersecurity analyst**. The company relies on a **remote database server** to store and process customer data, product details, and marketing analytics. Employees from different parts of the world **regularly query the database** to track customer engagement and sales performance.  

Upon conducting a **preliminary security review**, I discover that the **database server has been open to the public** since the company launched **three years ago**. This **major security vulnerability** could lead to **unauthorized access, data breaches, and operational disruptions**.  

My task is to **assess the risks**, communicate the findings to management, and recommend solutions to **secure the system**.

## 📅 Report Details  

| **Assessment Period** | **System Evaluated** |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| January 1, 2024 – March 31, 2024 (3 months) | **Remote Database Server** |

---

## 🖥️ System Description  

The company’s **database server** operates on **Debian Linux** with **1TB memory** and a **multi-core CPU** optimized for high-performance computing. It runs a **MySQL database management system** and communicates over an **IPv4 network**.  

However, **several security gaps** have been identified:  
- The database server is **publicly accessible**.  
- It uses **SSL instead of the more secure TLS** for encryption.  
- No **role-based access control (RBAC)** is in place.  
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** is not enforced for administrative access.  

---

## 🎯 Scope  

This report evaluates the **access control policies** and **security risks** associated with the company’s database infrastructure. The assessment follows the guidelines in [NIST SP 800-30] and similar **NIST frameworks**.  

---

## 🔍 Purpose  

The database stores **large volumes of sensitive business data**, including:  
✅ **Customer information** (emails, addresses, purchase history)  
✅ **Marketing analytics** (campaign performance, customer engagement)  
✅ **Financial records** (transaction logs, revenue reports)  

Given the critical nature of this data, the system **must be secured** to prevent **unauthorized access** and **data breaches**.

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment  

| **Threat Source**       | **Threat Event**                                           | **Likelihood** | **Severity** | **Risk Score** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Hackers**           | Exfiltrate sensitive data, expose it publicly | **3 (High)**  | **3 (High)**  | **9 (Critical)** |
| **Former Employees**  | Sell confidential data to competitors         | **2 (Medium)** | **3 (High)**  | **6 (High)** |
| **Current Employees** | Disrupt business operations                    | **2 (Medium)** | **3 (High)**  | **6 (High)** |
| **Customers**        | Alter stored data maliciously                  | **1 (Low)**    | **3 (High)**  | **3 (Moderate)** |

### 🛠️ Risk Analysis  
- **Hackers** could exploit the **open access** to steal sensitive data, leading to **regulatory fines** and **reputational damage**.  
- **Former employees** may **retain credentials** and **sell confidential information** to competitors.  
- **Internal employees** with **excessive permissions** could **accidentally or intentionally disrupt operations**.  
- **Customers** could **manipulate product listings or pricing** if access is not properly controlled.

## 🏗️ Remediation Strategy  

✅ **Restrict Public Access** – **Make the database private** and accessible only via an internal VPN or secure network.  

✅ **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Ensure **only authorized employees** can access critical database functions.  

✅ **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Require **SMS, email, or authentication apps** for login verification.  

✅ **Upgrade to TLS Encryption** – Transition from **SSL** to **TLS 1.3** to secure data transmission.  

✅ **Regular Access Audits** – Conduct **quarterly security reviews** to **remove inactive users** and **monitor access logs**.  

✅ **Least Privilege Principle** – Employees should **only have access** to the data **necessary for their job function**.

### 📌 Conclusion  

By implementing these **security enhancements**, SwiftCart Solutions can:  
✔️ **Reduce exposure to cyber threats**  
✔️ **Enhance data confidentiality & integrity**  
✔️ **Ensure compliance with industry standards**  
✔️ **Protect its reputation & customer trust**  

These recommendations align with **NIST guidelines** and industry best practices to **safeguard critical business data**.
