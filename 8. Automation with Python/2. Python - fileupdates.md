# Python - Update a File

## Description
You are a security professional working at a healthcare company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list. The following IPs need to be removed:

- `192.168.97.225`
- `192.168.158.170`
- `192.168.201.40`
- `192.168.58.57`

## Import and Read the File Contents

```python
# Import the file
import_file = "allow_list.txt" 

# Open the file and read its contents
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()  

# Display the ip_addresses
print(ip_addresses)
```

For the first part of the algorithm, I imported the `allow_list.txt` using the `import` module. I then used the `with open` statement to open the file. The `open()` function has two parameters: `import_file` and `r`. The first identifies the file to import, and the second indicates the action (read the file). Finally, I assigned the string output of this method to the variable `ip_addresses` and printed it. For your information, there are 17 IP addresses in `allow_list.txt`.

## Convert the String into a List

```python
# String into a list
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# `with` statement to read the contents
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()

# Convert from a string to a list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Display the `ip_addresses`
print(ip_addresses)
```

To remove individual IP addresses from the `allow list`, I had to convert the string format into a list format. I used `split()` to convert the `ip_addresses` string into a list.

The result:

```python
['ip_address', '192.168.25.60', '192.168.205.12', '192.168.97.225', '192.168.6.9', '192.168.52.90', '192.168.158.170', '192.168.90.124', '192.168.186.176', '192.168.133.188', '192.168.203.198', '192.168.201.40', '192.168.218.219', '192.168.52.37', '192.168.156.224', '192.168.60.153', '192.168.58.57', '192.168.69.116']
```

## Remove IP Addresses That Are on the Remove List

```python
# Import the file
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# List of IP addresses to remove
remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# `with` statement to read the contents
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()

# Convert from a string to a list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Build iterative statement to remove IPs in remove_list
for element in ip_addresses:
    if element in remove_list:
        ip_addresses.remove(element)

# Display the updated `ip_addresses`
print(ip_addresses)
```

I iterated through the `remove_list` using a `for` loop: `for element in remove_list:`. If the element is in the `remove_list`, then the current element is removed from `ip_addresses`. The keyword `in` allows iteration through the sequence, and the `.remove()` method successfully removes any matching IPs. The result shows that 4 IP addresses were removed.

The result:

```python
['ip_address', '192.168.25.60', '192.168.205.12', '192.168.6.9', '192.168.52.90', '192.168.90.124', '192.168.186.176', '192.168.133.188', '192.168.203.198', '192.168.218.219', '192.168.52.37', '192.168.156.224', '192.168.60.153', '192.168.69.116']
```

## Update the File With the Revised List of IP Addresses

```python
# Define file and remove list
import_file = "allow_list.txt"
remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# Read the file
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    ip_addresses = file.read()

# Convert from string to list
ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Remove IP addresses from the list
for element in ip_addresses:
    if element in remove_list:
        ip_addresses.remove(element)

# Convert `ip_addresses` back to a string
ip_addresses = " ".join(ip_addresses)

# Rewrite the file with the updated list of IP addresses
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    file.write(ip_addresses)

# Read and display the updated file content
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    text = file.read()

# Display the contents of the updated file
print(text)
```

As a final step, I updated the `allow list` with the revised list of IP addresses. The list was first converted back to a string, and the `.join()` method combined the list items into a string. The `open()` function with the `w` argument allowed me to overwrite the original file with the new IP addresses.

The updated `allow_list.txt` now contains 13 IP addresses.

## Summary
1. I opened the file and identified the IPs to be removed from `allow_list.txt`.
2. I converted the string into a list.
3. I removed the specified IP addresses from the list.
4. I converted the list back to a string format and updated the `allow_list.txt`.
