# Python - Automation

Automation with Python offers a powerful way to streamline repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and reduce errors. By using Python's robust libraries and tools, you can automate everything from system administration to web scraping and data processing. Python's versatility and ease of use make it an ideal language for automating complex workflows.

## Overview
In the context of security and systems management, Python is frequently used for automating tasks such as:
- Log collection and analysis
- Incident response
- Network monitoring
- Threat intelligence gathering

The script you will create in this example uses Python's automation capabilities to analyze logs, search for specific patterns, and generate reports that are critical for security operations.

## Scenario
You are tasked with automating the process of scanning system logs to identify failed login attempts. These logs contain critical information about potential security incidents, and automation will ensure that these attempts are detected and reported in a timely manner.

### Goal
- Parse system logs.
- Detect failed login attempts.
- Generate a report of suspicious activity.
- Send notifications to administrators.

## Step-by-step
### 1. Set Up Your Environment
Ensure that you have Python installed along with necessary packages. You can use pip to install the libraries:

```bash
pip install requests smtplib
```

### 2. Read the Log File
You will need to load and read logs to scan for failed login attempts. Python's built-in `open()` function and string methods are useful here.

```python
with open('/var/log/auth.log', 'r') as log_file:
    logs = log_file.readlines()
```

### 3. Search for Failed Login Attempts
You can use Pythonâ€™s `re` module (regular expressions) to identify specific patterns, such as failed login attempts.

```python
import re

failed_logins = []

for line in logs:
    if re.search(r'Failed password', line):
        failed_logins.append(line)
```

### 4. Generate the Report
After detecting failed login attempts, you can automate the generation of a report to send to security teams or system administrators.

```python
with open('failed_logins_report.txt', 'w') as report:
    for entry in failed_logins:
        report.write(entry)
```

### 5. Send Email Notifications
Once the report is generated, you can use Python's `smtplib` to send email notifications.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

msg = MIMEText('New failed login attempts detected. Please review the attached report.')
msg['Subject'] = 'Failed Login Attempts Report'
msg['From'] = 'security@yourdomain.com'
msg['To'] = 'admin@yourdomain.com'

with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.yourdomain.com') as server:
    server.login('your_username', 'your_password')
    server.sendmail(msg['From'], [msg['To']], msg.as_string())
```

### 6. Automate the Script
To ensure that this script runs automatically at regular intervals, use a task scheduler like cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows). This allows the script to execute at predefined times and keeps your logs constantly monitored for suspicious activity.

## Conclusion
By leveraging Python for automation, we can efficiently scan system logs for failed login attempts, generate detailed reports, and notify administrators. This minimizes manual effort and improves the ability to detect potential security issues promptly.

Automation is key to modern cybersecurity operations, and Python makes it accessible and flexible for any security analyst.
