# Final Report  

## Scenario  
On **January 22, 2024, at 7:20 PM PT**, the organization experienced a **security incident** in which an unauthorized individual gained access to **customer Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data**. Approximately **50,000 customer records** were compromised, leading to an estimated financial loss of **$100,000**, including direct costs and potential revenue loss.  

The incident began on **January 20, 2024, at 3:13 PM PT**, when an employee received an email from an unknown sender claiming to have stolen customer data. The attacker demanded **$25,000 in cryptocurrency** to prevent the data from being released. The employee, suspecting spam, ignored and deleted the email.  

On **January 22, 2024**, the same employee received a **follow-up email**, now including a **sample of stolen data** and an increased ransom demand of **$50,000**. At this point, the employee reported the email to the **security team**, triggering an internal investigation.  

Upon analysis, the **security team discovered a critical vulnerability in the e-commerce web application**. The attacker had exploited a **forced browsing vulnerability**, manipulating **order numbers in the purchase confirmation URL** to gain unauthorized access to transaction records.  

To mitigate the impact, the organization collaborated with **public relations** to disclose the breach and offered affected customers **free identity protection services**. The incident reinforced the importance of **routine security assessments and access control measures** to prevent future occurrences.

## Executive Summary  
A **forced browsing attack** was used to exploit an **e-commerce application vulnerability**, exposing **50,000 customer records**. The attacker initially demanded **$25,000**, later increasing the demand to **$50,000** after providing proof of stolen data. The breach resulted in **an estimated $100,000 loss**, prompting a full security investigation and remediation efforts.  

### **Key Recommendations:**  
- Strengthen **access control mechanisms**.  
- Conduct **regular vulnerability scans** and **penetration testing**.  
- Implement **allowlisting** to restrict access to authorized URLs.

| **Date & Time (PT)**  | **Event**  |  
|----------------|----------------|  
| **January 20, 2024, 3:13 PM**  | Employee receives an email claiming customer data theft; attacker demands $25,000 in cryptocurrency. Employee deletes the email.  |  
| **January 22, 2024, 7:20 PM**  | Employee receives a second email with **stolen data samples** and an increased ransom demand of **$50,000**.  |  
| **January 22, 2024, 7:45 PM**  | Employee reports the incident to the **security team**, triggering an investigation.  |  
| **January 23, 2024**  | Security team discovers a **forced browsing vulnerability** in the web application.  |  
| **January 24, 2024**  | Organization **publicly discloses the breach** and provides affected customers with **identity protection services**.  |

## Investigation Findings  
### **Root Cause Analysis**  
- The attacker exploited a **forced browsing vulnerability** in the e-commerce platform.  
- By modifying the **order number in the purchase confirmation URL**, the attacker accessed **thousands of customer transaction records**.  
- The attacker exfiltrated sensitive information and used it to **blackmail the organization for ransom**.  

### **Digital Forensics Analysis**  
- **Web application logs** confirmed multiple unauthorized access attempts.  
- **IP addresses traced to foreign locations** indicated external threat actors.  
- **No evidence of internal compromise**, but additional **security training** for employees was recommended.  

---

## Response & Remediation  
- The **security team patched the forced browsing vulnerability** within 24 hours of discovery.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** was enforced for all administrative access.  
- **Access control mechanisms** were revised to **restrict URL-based data retrieval**.  
- **Affected customers were notified**, and **identity protection services** were provided.  
- **Incident response procedures** were revised to improve early threat detection.

## Recommendations for Prevention  
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following **security measures** should be implemented:  

### **1. Routine Security Assessments:**  
- Conduct **periodic vulnerability scans** and **penetration tests** to identify and remediate potential threats.  

### **2. Enhanced Access Controls:**  
- Implement **allowlisting** to restrict URL access to authorized users.  
- Enforce **role-based access control (RBAC)** to minimize unnecessary data exposure.  

### **3. Secure Development Practices:**  
- Require **parameterized queries** to prevent unauthorized URL modifications.  
- Implement **security-focused code reviews** before deploying updates.  

### **4. Incident Response Training:**  
- Conduct **employee security awareness training** on **phishing and ransomware threats**.  
- Develop **playbooks for handling extortion attempts** and suspicious communications.  

By implementing these recommendations, the organization can **strengthen its cybersecurity posture** and **reduce the risk of future breaches**.
