# Final Report

## Scenario  
On **March 5, 2024, at 2:45 a.m. ET**, the organization detected a security breach where an unauthorized entity gained access to customer **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** and **payment details**. The breach compromised approximately **75,000 customer records**, with an estimated **financial impact of $250,000** in direct costs and potential revenue loss.  

The first sign of an attack appeared on **March 3, 2024, at 11:10 a.m.**, when a customer support agent received multiple reports from users about unauthorized transactions on their accounts. The agent escalated the issue, but no immediate action was taken as it was assumed to be individual cases of stolen credentials.  

On **March 5, 2024**, a cybersecurity analyst discovered abnormal API request patterns targeting the company's **order processing system**. Further investigation revealed that attackers exploited an **unpatched API vulnerability** that allowed them to enumerate user accounts and extract sensitive order data. By **March 6, 2024**, the security team contained the breach, revoked unauthorized access, and initiated forensic analysis.  

The company issued a **public breach notification** and provided affected customers with **one year of free credit monitoring**. This incident underscores the critical need for **API security best practices, proactive threat detection, and continuous monitoring** to prevent future breaches.

## Executive Summary  
A **high-severity data breach** was detected on **March 5, 2024**, affecting approximately **75,000 customer records**. Attackers exploited a **vulnerable API endpoint** to extract user data, leading to unauthorized transactions and exposure of **PII and payment details**. The estimated financial loss is **$250,000**, including potential legal fees and compensation costs.  

The breach has been contained, and a full security audit is underway. To **mitigate future risks**, the following actions are recommended:  
- **Implement robust API security** with authentication and rate limiting.  
- **Conduct regular vulnerability assessments** and penetration testing.  
- **Enhance monitoring** to detect suspicious activity in real time.

## Investigation  
The security team conducted a forensic analysis to **identify the root cause and impact** of the breach. Key findings include:  

- **Root Cause:**  
  - A misconfigured **API endpoint** allowed unauthorized access to customer order records.  
  - Attackers exploited this flaw to **enumerate user accounts** and extract data.  

- **Attack Methodology:**  
  - The attackers sent **automated API requests** to retrieve sensitive information.  
  - They then **sold stolen customer credentials** on dark web marketplaces.  

- **Compromised Data:**  
  - Full names, email addresses, shipping addresses.  
  - Partial credit card details (last four digits).  
  - Order history and transaction details.  

---

## Response and Remediation  
- **Emergency patches** were applied to fix the API vulnerability.  
- Affected customer accounts were **forced to reset passwords**.  
- Security logs were reviewed to **identify unauthorized access points**.  
- A **public disclosure and customer notification** process was initiated.  
- **Legal teams** were engaged to address compliance and potential liability.

## Recommendations  
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following security improvements should be implemented:  

1. **Strengthen API Security:**  
   - Enforce **OAuth2 authentication** and **rate-limiting controls**.  
   - Implement **IP whitelisting** for sensitive API endpoints.  

2. **Enhance Monitoring & Threat Detection:**  
   - Deploy **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** for real-time threat alerts.  
   - Implement **automated log analysis** for early anomaly detection.  

3. **Routine Security Audits:**  
   - Conduct **quarterly penetration tests** targeting API endpoints.  
   - Ensure all **third-party integrations follow security best practices**.  

4. **Incident Response Preparedness:**  
   - Develop a **detailed playbook** for handling data breaches.  
   - Perform **regular tabletop exercises** to test response effectiveness.  

By implementing these measures, the organization can **proactively detect and prevent** future API-based attacks, safeguarding customer data and business operations.
