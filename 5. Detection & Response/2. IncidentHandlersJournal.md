# Incident Handler's Journal  

## Overview  
**Incident ID:** 2024-IR-002  
**Date Opened:** March 5, 2024  
**Date Closed:** March 8, 2024  
**Incident Type:** Data Breach – API Exploitation  
**Affected Systems:** Order Processing API, Customer Database  
**Impact Level:** High  
**Incident Status:** Closed  

---

## Initial Detection  
**Date & Time:** March 5, 2024 – 2:45 a.m. ET  
**Detected By:** Security Operations Center (SOC)  
**Detection Method:** Anomaly detection alerts flagged a high volume of **unauthorized API requests** attempting to access customer order data.  

### First Observations:  
- API logs showed **unusual query patterns**, indicating potential enumeration attacks.  
- A spike in **failed authentication attempts** followed by a sudden surge of successful queries.  
- External reports from customers experiencing **unauthorized transactions**.  

**Immediate Actions Taken:**  
✔️ Alerted Incident Response Team (IRT).  
✔️ Blocked suspicious IPs associated with the unauthorized requests.  
✔️ Notified customer support to monitor for increased fraud complaints.

## Root Cause Analysis  
🔍 **Attack Methodology:**  
- Attackers exploited an **unsecured API endpoint** that allowed **order history retrieval without authentication**.  
- By iterating order numbers in the URL, attackers **enumerated user data**, exposing sensitive records.  

🔍 **Vulnerability Details:**  
- API endpoint failed to enforce **proper authentication checks**.  
- No **rate limiting**, allowing thousands of requests per minute.  
- No **logging alerts** were in place for unusual query patterns.  

---

## Lessons Learned  
💡 **What Went Wrong?**  
- Lack of **strict authentication controls** on the affected API.  
- **Delayed response** due to misclassification of initial customer fraud reports.  
- **Ineffective monitoring**, failing to flag unusual data access patterns earlier.  

💡 **What Worked Well?**  
✔️ Rapid **identification and mitigation** once the security team got involved.  
✔️ Coordinated **cross-team communication** to patch the vulnerability quickly.  
✔️ **Legal and compliance teams** ensured regulatory transparency and swift customer communication.

## Remediation Actions  
### 🔧 Short-Term Fixes:  
✅ **Applied security patches** to enforce proper authentication and authorization.  
✅ **Updated firewall rules** to block automated scanning of order numbers.  
✅ **Manually reviewed logs** to identify any remaining unauthorized access.  

### 🛡️ Long-Term Improvements:  
🔹 **Strengthened API security** – Implemented OAuth2 authentication and strict access controls.  
🔹 **Enabled rate limiting** – Prevented bulk API requests to limit enumeration attempts.  
🔹 **Deployed advanced logging and SIEM rules** – Improved anomaly detection for early warnings.  
🔹 **Developed an API security checklist** – Ensured all new endpoints follow best practices.  
🔹 **Scheduled regular penetration tests** – Quarterly security assessments for API vulnerabilities.
