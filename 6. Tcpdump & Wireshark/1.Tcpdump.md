# Tcpdump - Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic  

## Scenario  
As a network analyst, your task is to use **tcpdump** to capture and analyze live network traffic on a **Linux virtual machine**.  

Your Linux terminal is pre-configured with a user account named **analyst**, and your home directory contains a **sample packet capture file** that you will analyze later in the lab.  

The steps to complete this task are:  
1. Identifying available network interfaces for packet capture.  
2. Using **tcpdump** to filter live network traffic.  
3. Capturing network traffic and saving it to a file.  
4. Filtering and analyzing the captured packet data.

## Solution  

### 1. Identify Available Network Interfaces  
To list the available network interfaces for packet capture, use:  
```bash
ifconfig
```
or  
```bash
ip link show
```
Identify which interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`) is actively transmitting data.

### 2. Inspect Network Traffic in Real Time  
To analyze live network traffic from a specific interface, use **tcpdump**:  
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5
```
- `-i eth0` → Captures packets from the **eth0** interface.  
- `-v` → Displays detailed packet headers.  
- `-c5` → Captures only **5 packets** before stopping.  

---

### 3. Capture Network Traffic to a File  
To capture HTTP traffic on port **80** and save it for later analysis:  
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &
```
- `-i eth0` → Captures packets from the **eth0** interface.  
- `-nn` → Disables IP and port name resolution (avoids unnecessary DNS lookups).  
- `-c9` → Captures **9 packets** before stopping.  
- `port 80` → Filters packets related to HTTP traffic.  
- `-w capture.pcap` → Saves captured packets to a file named **capture.pcap**.  
- `&` → Runs the command in the **background** so other commands can be executed simultaneously.  

To generate sample HTTP traffic, open a website using **curl**:  
```bash
curl opensource.google.com
```
Verify that packets were captured using:  
```bash
ls -l capture.pcap
```

---

### 4. Analyze the Captured Packet Data  

#### View Basic Packet Information  
To display packet headers from the captured file:  
```bash
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v
```
- `-nn` → Disables port and protocol name resolution.  
- `-r capture.pcap` → Reads packets from the saved file.  
- `-v` → Displays **detailed** packet headers.  

#### Inspect Packets in Detail (Hex & ASCII Output)  
For a deeper analysis, view **hexadecimal** and **ASCII** representations of packet data:  
```bash
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X
```
- `-X` → Displays raw **hex** and **ASCII** content of each packet, useful for forensic analysis and malware detection.  

**Note:**  
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)** represents values using digits (0-9) and letters (A-F).  
- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** represents text in digital form.

## Conclusion  
Using **tcpdump**, we successfully:  
✅ Identified active network interfaces.  
✅ Captured **live network traffic**.  
✅ Saved the traffic to a **.pcap** file for further analysis.  
✅ Filtered and analyzed packet data using different **tcpdump** options.  

This process is essential for **network forensics**, **troubleshooting**, and **security investigations**.
