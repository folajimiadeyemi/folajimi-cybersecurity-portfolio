# Wireshark - Packet Analysis for Security Investigations

## Scenario
As a security analyst, you need to analyze network traffic to investigate a potential security event.  
You have access to a packet capture (PCAP) file containing data from a web browsing session.  
Your goal is to filter and examine network traffic using Wireshark to uncover key details about the interaction.  

### Objectives:
1. Identify the **source** and **destination** IP addresses involved in the network session.  
2. Analyze the **protocols** used in the communication.  
3. Examine the **packet data** to determine the nature of the information exchanged.

## Solutions

### 1. Identify Source and Destination IP Addresses  
To determine the devices communicating in this session, apply the following filters in Wireshark:  

- **Filter for a specific IP address (either source or destination):**  
  `ip.addr == 192.168.1.100`  

- **Filter for traffic originating from a specific IP:**  
  `ip.src == 192.168.1.100`  

- **Filter for traffic directed to a specific IP:**  
  `ip.dst == 192.168.1.100`  

- **Filter by Ethernet MAC address:**  
  `eth.addr == 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`  

By using these filters, you can isolate relevant packets and track communication paths.

### 2. Analyze Network Protocols Used  
To understand the nature of the communication, inspect the transport-layer protocols:  

- **Filter for HTTP traffic (default web traffic):**  
  `tcp.port == 80`  
  HTTP typically operates on TCP port 80 for unencrypted web traffic.  

- **Filter for HTTPS traffic (secure web browsing):**  
  `tcp.port == 443`  
  HTTPS traffic is encrypted using SSL/TLS.  

- **Filter for DNS traffic (domain name resolution):**  
  `udp.port == 53`  
  DNS queries and responses use UDP port 53.  

- **Example observation:**  
  - Source IP: `192.168.1.100`  
  - Destination IP: `203.0.113.45`  
  - Protocol: `TCP`  
  - Destination port: `80` (indicating an HTTP request)

### 3. Inspect Packet Data for Insights  
To analyze the content of packets and identify potential security concerns:  

- **Filter for specific port traffic:**  
  `tcp.port == 80`  
  This isolates HTTP traffic for review.  

- **Check "Time to Live" (TTL) values:**  
  TTL indicates how many network hops a packet can take before being discarded.  
  A low TTL may indicate the packet traveled a short distance.  

- **Example packet details:**  
  - **Frame Number:** `42`  
  - **Frame Length:** `512 bytes`  
  - **TTL:** `64` (suggesting the packet originated from a local network)  

- **Display packet details in hexadecimal and ASCII format:**  
  `tcp.port == 80 && frame.len > 500`  
  This helps identify large HTTP responses, such as file downloads or large data transfers.

## Key Takeaways  
- Wireshark enables deep packet inspection to uncover security threats.  
- Filtering techniques help isolate relevant network activity.  
- Understanding protocols and analyzing packet contents is crucial for network forensics.  

By mastering these techniques, you can enhance your ability to detect and respond to security incidents effectively.
