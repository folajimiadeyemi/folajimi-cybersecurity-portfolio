# Network Security

## Case Study  
**Company Name:** CyberFort Systems   

CyberFort Systems is a mid-sized tech company that provides cloud-based business solutions. As the company scales, securing its network infrastructure has become a top priority. The IT security team has identified potential vulnerabilities in network segmentation, firewall configurations, and intrusion detection mechanisms.  

To strengthen CyberFortâ€™s security posture, a **Network Security Assessment** will be conducted to evaluate existing defenses, identify weaknesses, and implement security enhancements.

## Network Security Assessment  

### **1. Network Architecture Review**  
- Review of internal and external network segmentation.  
- Analysis of firewall rules and configurations.  
- Identification of open ports and unnecessary services.  

### **2. Intrusion Detection and Prevention**  
- Deployment and testing of **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** such as Suricata or Snort.  
- Implementation of **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)** for automated threat blocking.  
- Log analysis to detect unusual network activity.  

### **3. Network Traffic Monitoring**  
- Use of **Wireshark** and **tcpdump** to analyze network packets.  
- Identifying suspicious traffic patterns and potential threats.  
- Monitoring for **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks.  

### **4. Secure Remote Access & VPN Configuration**  
- Assessing Virtual Private Network (VPN) configurations for secure remote access.  
- Implementing **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for remote employees.  
- Hardening Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to prevent brute-force attacks.  

### **5. Network Hardening Measures**  
- Disabling unused network services and ports.  
- Enforcing strong authentication mechanisms.  
- Regularly updating and patching network devices.

## Findings & Recommendations  
| Issue | Risk Level | Recommended Fix |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Open ports exposing internal services | High | Restrict access with firewall rules |
| Weak or default passwords on network devices | High | Enforce strong password policies |
| Lack of intrusion detection system | Medium | Deploy IDS/IPS for real-time threat detection |
| No VPN encryption for remote access | High | Configure VPN with strong encryption |
| Outdated router firmware | Medium | Apply latest security patches |

### **Conclusion**  
The network security assessment identified several critical issues that need to be addressed to ensure CyberFort Systems' infrastructure remains secure. By implementing these recommendations, the company can reduce the risk of cyberattacks and strengthen its overall security posture.
